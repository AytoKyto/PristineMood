				<h3>Knowledgeable</h3>
				<p>
					Our scientific committee helps us monitor the available international intelligence about CSR on an annual basis. The past years have shown that green science has often contradicted itself and is permanently discovering new challenges and new solutions. Our scientific committee is continuously looking for additional experts to enlarge its scope.

				<h3>Adapted to luxury travel, to luxury travel<br/> stakeholders and <br/>to travellers </h3>
				<p>
					Our shared experience shows that industry professionals might be less aware than consumers, but they are more actively engaged while consumers are very aware but often less actively engaged. Pristine Mood aims at leveraging the professionals in our industry to actively reach and also engage the luxury traveller. 
					Travel designers especially will play a pivotal role in educating the traveller about the most sustainable ways to travel, which should ultimately become a lifestyle choice. They will be supported by as many luxury travel suppliers as possible, through the sustainable solutions they will offer.

				<h3>Creative</h3>
				<p>
					Wide eyed approaches and out of the box solutions shall be considered in addition to scientific knowledge. It is about implementing actions that specifically match our luxury travel industry. It is also about watching and being inspired by the progress of other industries. It is finally about paradigm shift, about re-assessing habit acceptance in the light of an urgent necessity for change.
